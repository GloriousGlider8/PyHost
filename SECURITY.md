`host.yml` is located in the main folder and deafults to:

```yaml
denylist:
  - null
allowlist:
  - null
use: all
conflict:
  allow:
    - localhost
  deny:
    - null

```

In JSON that is:

```json
{
  "denylist": [
    null
  ],
  "allowlist": [
    null
  ],
  "use": "all"
  "conflict": {
    "allow": [
      "localhost"
    ],
    "deny": [
      null
    ]
  },
  "type": "text/html",
  "code": 200
}

You can edit it safely.

**If you do not know YAML, the settings menu changes this safely.**
